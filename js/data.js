One day, Julia leaves her old crayons with Ivan who suddenly begins taking an interest in drawing with them. Julia is apparently the only one who can decipher his drawings and what they mean. The Big Top Mall begins losing business, much to Mack\'s concern, but becomes excited when he purchases a baby elephant named Ruby who begins to draw in a crowd. Ivan is initially hesitant over accepting Ruby, especially when she begins to pry into his personal life. When Stella, who has been caring for Ruby, suddenly becomes weaker and unable to perform, Ivan gives Ruby encouragement to embrace the crowd on her own. Afterwards, Ruby asks Ivan to tell her a story and Ivan reveals how Mack and his wife Helen adopted him when he was just a baby. As Ivan got bigger, Mack became forgiving of his animalistic behavior, but Helen left him out of frustration. Mack eventually purchased the mall and turned it into a circus. Stella asks Ivan to look after Ruby and make sure she is free before passing away.'
